ðŸ§ª Testing with Cookie Restoration Disabled
============================================

Changes made:
- Disabled automatic cookie restoration during auth initialization
- This should prevent the auth state from being set before user logs in
- Login should still work and set cookies, but no initial loop

Please test:
1. Clear browser cookies for localhost:3000
2. Refresh the login page
3. Page should show login form (not 'Redirecting...')
4. Try logging in - should redirect to dashboard after successful login
5. Check console for debug messages

Expected behavior:
- No initial 'Redirecting to dashboard...' message
- Clean login form on first visit
- Successful redirect after login

If this fixes the loop, I'll implement a proper cookie restoration solution that doesn't cause loops.
